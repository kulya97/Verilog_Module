# DSP Core Generation 
## Introduction

This is a customizable DSP Core module with various algorithms for DSP Decomposition listed below with their respective multiplicand bit widths:
1. Karatsuba Algoritm with k = 18 for both signed and unsigned multiplications.
2. Pipelined Karatsuba Algorithm with k = 18 for unsigned and k = 17 for signed multiplications.
    * Multiplications between 18 (17 for signed) and 36 (34 for signed) bit wide numbers will take 2 clock cycles to compute.
    * Multiplications between 36 (34 for signed) and 54 (51 for signed) bit wide numbers will take 3 clock cycles to compute.
    * Multiplications between 54 (51 for signed) and 72 (68 for signed) bit wide numbers will take 4 clock cycles to compute.
3. Karatsuba-Ofman Algorithm with k = 17 for unsigned and k = 16 for signed multiplications.

For more information, refer to the included documentation.

## Generator Script
This directory contains the generator script which places the generated RTL to `rapidsilicon/ip/dsp_generator/v1_0/<build-name>/src/` directory along with the simulation files.

## Parameters
These are the parameters for DSP core along with their keyword and values: -

To generate RTL with above parameters, run the following command:
```
python3 dsp_generator_gen.py --build --a_width=54 --b_width=54
```

## TCL File

This python script also generates a raptor.tcl file which will be placed in `rapidsilicon/ip/dsp_generator/v1_0/<build-name>/synth/` directory.
